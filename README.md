# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Titanic
This is my first thesis, and its goal is to use statistical modelling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get insights and eventually predict survivor (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived) using the Titanic Dataset. Approximately 38% of the 891 passengers who boarded the Titanic survived, while the remainder, 62%, perished in the catastrophe.
